we see that the peak of the spanish selection is the goalkeeper iker casillas , who last saturday against england ( game lost with 0-1 in london ) equaled the record of the ex goalkeeper andoni zubizarreta , with 126 international matches .
on costa rican side , and close to michael umana , are the left - lateral junior diaz , with 48 matches and the striker bryan ruiz , with 45 .
on the national side , with less than 30 presences , there are roy miller with 26 , winston parks with 26 , gabriel badilla with 25 and roy myrie with 23 .
while nacho moreal has only four games and jordi alba two , in costa rica victor bolivar has only one olman vargas and nelson edder did not debut yet .
for costa rica , bryan ruiz is the one that registers more points , two more than carlos hernandez and three more than roy myrie and parks .
' going to costa rica is a dream come true '
there were more than 20 years of wait , but the band says that for the member is also a dream turned into reality playing in the country .
the group is on the south american zone within the tour celebrating two decades of work and sunday 20th will make its only stop in central america .
this is an excerpt of the conversation , whose full transcript is online in the nation .
going to costa rica is a dream come true for us too .
i 've been to costa rica only once , on vacation , it is a beautiful country and i think we 'll be able to stay a few days there .
i ask this because there is a kind of devotion to the band ; the fans live with intensity the days before the concert .
thank you for staying with us through all these years .
some people as regards your concert refer to it as the biggest show of the year .
some of the biggest shows we 've played over the past 21 years occurred during the last couple of weeks .
really , we are very eager to play there .
how did you discover costa rica and its waves for surfing ?
my friends are always going to surf in costa rica and nicaragua , along with mexico , these are great places to surf , and that 's how we learned about , through people who love surfing .
we will try to make the best show possible with a good variety of songs ; we will try to play a couple of songs of each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire .
when we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have not been playing for a while , this keeps us focused and keeps us surprised because it reminds us the reasons why we liked those songs and that we might have forgotten .
we count our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue making music together .
we are fortunate to go to places in the world where we always wanted to go .
what does it mean for you having been a fundamental part of the rise of grunge ?
we are good friends of the people of soundgarden , mudhoney and alice in chains .
from time to time , arises a band of a city , but it is much more strange when five or ten bands come out at the same time from the same city .
i still play with some of them from time to time .
it is also very strange that a band like yours remains united with the same members for so long .
first , i think we are all lucky to be still alive and , secondly , we all care about the others .
we trust each other with the music of each and this could not be better .
we take care of not being too much on tour because it is easy to fall into this game of big crowds and people who love your music .
how do you remember your other project manother love bone ?
we were a band for almost three years and never released an album until after the death of andy ( andrew woods ) .
it was a remarkable man and we miss him .
is it true that you know its work , especially eddie vedder , and that 's why you chose it for the opening ?
why do you always change the lyrics of yellow ledbetter live ?
he sings it and i think he does this with the first thing that comes to his mind .
there are so many i could talk all afternoon about the bassists that i love .
i think all of us feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge .
at first , your music had a darker content , and now has become more positive .
it 's interesting because i think there are a couple of songs on the album that may appear lighter , but there are songs like the end or just breathe that are qualified as very dark although they can sound a little positive .
i think that when you grow up and there was some trauma in your life and you lost a family member or friend , these things start to influence your art and your music and these two songs certainly represent that for me .
the ex president alberto fujimori was hospitalized tuesday in a public hospital in order to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength that occurs in the legs , informed his family doctor .
the congressman alejandro aguinaga , who is his personal physician , told to canal n of television that fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the national institute of neoplastic diseases in order to determine the reason for the pain and the loss of strength in his lower limbs .
he had surgery four times for cancer of the tongue , has a weight loss of 18 kilos to which other diseases were added such as severe erosive gastritis , pancreatic cysts , kidney stones , high blood pressure and circulation problems in the legs , listed the doctor .
in april 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years of prison for killing 25 people at the hands of a squad of annihilation of the army that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government .
an official delegation headed by the uruguayan president josé mujica , and composed of several ministers and businessmen , will begin this tuesday a visit to mexico in order to expand trade between the two countries and to approach political issues in the region .
the meeting between both presidents , in the city of guadalajara , will be " favorable for the exchange of information as regards the political issues between the two nations , " as published the presidency of the south american country on its website .
in his speech , sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens , a statement that caused the refusal of uruguay and the call to consultation of its ambassador in the european country .
the uruguayan government has attempted in recent years to speed up the conclusion of tax exchanging arrangements in order to leave the " gray list " of the organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) , composed of countries that did not implement all international standards of tax cooperation .
the mustachioed plumber comes to be three - dimensional with " super mario 3d land "
the title , which arrives in the stores around the world this month , has been designed to exploit the features of the potable console nintendo 3ds , which allows playing in three dimensions without the need of using glasses .
alvarez said that " super mario 3d land " is " the first video game of nintendo originally designed for this support , " because until now successes like " star fox 64 3d " or " zelda : ocarina of time 3d " were adaptations of existing titles .
alvarez said that " super mario 3d land " contains two games in one : the first part is " simple " to engage less skilled users .
in addition , the users can choose in real - time between " d aggressive " or one that only affects the depth of the action , but will need to be played in three dimensions in order to overcome the various challenges and " not to succumb optical illusions . "
in this game nintendo winks to the fans of the series and repeats the successful formula of the previous games , the plumber with mustache will have to go through dangerous mined platforms in order to free princess peach .
thus ends the process for guatemala to respond to the request of north country that claimed for portillo to judge him there .
he stated that during his mandate he did not " put his hands " in judicial decisions and accepted all extradition proceedings he has ever known .
what 's done by colom represents an executive process after getting exhausted all legal and constitutional courts to prosecute the ex head of state between 2000 and 2004 .
portillo was acquitted of embezzlement of q 120 million in the defense ministry when he was a president , which was the process that preceded the extradition , but the public ministry appealed and reopened the case .
the entity was created to prevent the fall on the margins of the society of untrained young men
to this there are added over a hundred jobs currently created ​​for this social group .
trinijove was born in the neighborhood of trinitat vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little education , no job , and drug problems or at risk of falling into marginality .
the diverse political representation , in the election time , showed the unitary character of the work done by trinijove .
also attended at the fabra i coats the actual counselor for social welfare and family , josep lluís cleries and ceo of the social work of la caixa , jaume lanaspa .
the president gave trinijove as an example for fighting against the bad circumstances and giving hope to people with difficulties .
twelve people left voluntarily yesterday at noon the property they were illegally occupying , and where they organized macro parties that exasperated the neighborhood , by court order without police intervention .
" from now on there will be an access control , " said the manager .
the first three floors were the scene of mass parties , which lasted up to two days and exasperated the tenants .
the owner , maria pantinat told to europa press that since the building was occupied her business went down 80 % .
in addition , the owner of the disco had to respond to neighborhood complaints of noise , while , as she noted , the noise was not caused by customers of the club , but by the inhabitants of the squat and , above all , those attending the parties that were organized there , which had increased in frequency and intensity in recent weeks , as the angry neighbors said .
the city police also confirmed that in recent weeks has received more complaints from neighbors about the situation .
the popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied , but over the last few months the squatters had entered into all floors and in almost every floor and that in some of them occurred burglaries .
also yesterday , the members of the police evacuated a building in nou barris .
the architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversies over fees
in mid 80 's at the height of the now extinct metropolitan corporation of barcelona ( mcb ) , this administration printed promotional leaflets of collserola .
moreover , it was accompanied by a comparison , in figures , with the new york central park .
this was all about until , in september , the council called for a mega competition composed of 16 contests for as many other doors to collserola .
either that or someone wants to put gates to the field .
the competition , both as for its merely organizational side as for its reflection on the city is a topic of conversation among all architects of barcelona .
and this fact gives rise precisely to one of the few similarities between what three architects of barcelona are saying and the academics , which have been presented .
for roland , after approaching the coastline becomes " necessary " to discuss about " the mountain front , " whenever ildefons cerda 's speech , that of green apples has not been carried out .
modolo , as roland and bayona with experience in the urban world , called the proposal " intellectual challenge " with " some dangers . "
the first fear is the own delimitation of the borders where to build .
" we must think of new urban planning tools , because the current [ in reference to the general metropolitan plan ( gmp ) ] can lead to a real disaster . "
modolo remembers that there is already a work done by the board of collserola that " should not fall on deaf ears , " although he is grateful for the opportunity that the city hall offers to his profession to intervene in this project " from the very beginning . "
bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex , because the contest rules lack a global view of collserola : " 16 cross contests have been called - he says - on sea - mountain sense , but there is no longitudinal reading , to see and understand the area as a whole . "
otherwise , a project for one of the gates can crash into the program and definition with the project of the architect of the next gate .
after spending 72 days in jail , manuel jonas larrazabal will be free after the legal representative of the red casino granted him forgiveness before the second criminal court district , which follows a process of blackmail against the brother of the mayor of monterrey .
after the public condemnation , the state general attorney opened a criminal case against the mayor 's brother and on september 2nd , he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days .
in this place he remained for 49 days following the pronunciation of a second restriction order after the prosecutor dismissed the crimes of bribery and organized crime .
the authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells boarding san nicolas of garza .
on monday , the legal representative of red casino , victor aldo garcia gomez , appeared before the judge josé luis pecina to seek pardon for the regional mayor 's brother , so that in the coming hours he might regain his freedom .
based on the record 197/2011 legal pardon is granted to jonas larrazabal and thereafter there may not be made ​​any claim about the process that was intended against him ; also no damage repair or punishment will be required .
the clerk of the court , jorge yanez , went to the jail of the municipality of san nicolas of garza to notify jonah that he has been legally pardoned and his record will be filed .
the secretary dionisio perez jacome gives details of the crash where the interior minister , francisco blake , and seven others died .
during a press conference , dionisio perez jacome , minister of communications and transport , said that before the aircraft took off , the pilot found that weather conditions were suitable for the flight .
he also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people , so it fulfilled the necessary requirements to transport people .
" in a research it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship in another place , the impact is presented in a structural way .
the land has a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees .
meanwhile , gilberto lopez meyer , general director of airports and auxiliary services , said that at the time of the impact , the presidential helicopter was operating in cruising speed and that this happened in a soft ascending land .
at the press conference , the owner of the sct , perez jacome , listed six important elements in the investigation :
according to the aviation regulations the flight was conducted under visual flight rules , this means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the ground .
aicm reports were indicating suitable conditions for taking off as the aircraft moved towards the border area between mexico city and mexico state there were layers of clouds at low altitudes .
it is likely that due to cloud conditions the crew has searched an area of lower elevation and greater visibility into the valley of cuernavaca .
the coordinates of the impact and the last record of the aircraft radar match , probably before the impact there was no loss of control or change in the flight direction .
the information available so far suggests that the impact occurred in a straight and lateral line .
the pictures show the sequence in which it dismantled along that journey .
after a thorough research in a wider area than the surrendered off area , near the place the accident took place , there have not been found scattered pieces of the aircraft , which strengthens the assumption that the impact is presented in terms of structural integrity .
social security directs a research to find the gene for obesity in children and young people ; it is supported by specialists from the ipn
in a statement , the head of the medical research unit in biochemistry of specialties hospital , xxi century national medical center , miguel cruz lopez , explained that it was integrated a multidisciplinary team of physicians , nurses , nutritionists and social workers .
the research invites the population entitled or not , to participate by going to the participant sport units of the mssi in the valley of mexico , where there will be carried out the tests to children , every saturday from 8:00 o'clock .
once reached the goal of bringing 500 to 600 children , the study will continue in the independence sport unit ( south the mexico city ) and finally in the morelos sports unit ( north the mexico city ) .
on november 14th , there will be celebrated the world diabetes day , and the goal is to collect three thousand children and young people between 6 and 14 years , with the consent and parental supervision for the implementation of specific questionnaires on food .
he explained that on saturday to all participants will be applied anthropometric measurements ( weight , height , and waist circumference ) , blood pressure measurements , and determination of glucose , triglycerides , cholesterol and insulin and genetic ( seeking to identify genes that are associated to childhood obesity ) .
health surveys made between 1999 and 2006 reported that in only six years there was an increase in the case of the boys , 77 percent were obese , and 47 percent in the case of the girls ; in terms of overweight there was also observed a dramatic rise , " said the specialist of the mssi .
he reported that on average , the mexican has a 65 percent of american indian heritage , 30 percent european and five percent african and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and overweight .
the researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is a comprehensive assessment of the children , which can detect if they have any degree of overweight or obesity .
the information is handled with confidentiality , doctors deliver it in writing to the parents , to whom they explain each of the measurements and changes in the lifestyle that have to be undertaken in order to prevent disease .
also it is due to the high caloric intake , meaning , and the increased consumption of sugary drinks , carbohydrate ( tamales , bread , pizza , hamburger , etc. ) with high fat and protein and genetics analyzed in this protocol .
rafael herrera , a researcher at the faculty of chemistry of unam , develops polymer - modified asphalt to produce a mixture with the best performance , regardless of the environmental conditions and temperature
in his lecture a technological view of the pothole , issued under the international year of chemistry , announced that the laboratory he is responsible for is developing a polymer modified asphalt to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to the asphalt , but with a better mechanical strength , both at high and low temperatures .
he explained that the asphalt , the heavier oil part is a set of hydrocarbon molecules , some of high molecular weight , called asphaltenes , and other of low molecular weight , called maltenes , which together give the road surface its viscoelastic characteristic behavior .
this means that the resistance of the street asphalt is not uniform , but is modified during the day according to the environmental conditions and temperature , said the specialist in chemical engineering .
among the most superficial layers is the asphalt , composed of small stones dipped into the asphalt and then compacted .
when driving vehicles and generating effort , it allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement .
on the asphalt covering , he added , is placed a final layer called rolling covering , which is made ​​of a fine stone material , meaning sand also dipped into the asphalt .
as being the part of the pavement that will receive and diffuse the efforts , the rolling covering also requires proper thickness and the material it is made of must be take into consideration .
when the ground is wet , water diffuses inside the covering and it 's hard to get out , this causing a softening of all layers of the pavement and , therefore , the formation of potholes .
also a member of the national system of researchers explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and , therefore , the thickness of each layer of the pavement should be always made in relation to the vehicle load and ensure this fulfillment , in order to prevent the frequent formation of potholes .
what did the candidate of valley lack to be the new miss colombia ?
this time melina ramirez serna had to be content with being on the winning podium , wearing the silver crown and the band that accredited her as the new princess of colombia .
the first key factor in the decision of the jury to designate her as first princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question " ' what is the book that has marked you and why ? asked ​​by martin murillo gomez from the literary cart let 's read .
" i read a lot , i believe a lot in literature , i think it is a form of culturalization , and i definitely think that the book that marked my childhood is " the little prince ' is a pretty deep book .
a response that the jury did not like due to the term " culturalization ' and second of all for not specifically explaining how each of the cited books have marked her .
and for you all , please read a little bit , ' the little prince ' it is a great book "
a reporter from bogota suggested that for being the preferred , the acclaimed , and the candidate who received all preliminary awards ( oster food challenge , the public vote for the best traditional costume , and mother queen ) , " that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates , stressed the queen and therefore she did not shine on stage .
although in both she looked confident , it was noted that she lacked the strength and energy that magdalena and atlántico representatives did show .
in addition , valley lately avoided talking to the press , and that was wrong .
this is why , two days before the election the international jury lucy doughty said they were seeking a woman committed to the social needs of her country .
there is also a speculation that valley sinned for her defects on the posterior and the fibrosis that could be seen on her abdomen , but it is contradictory because the jury specifically chose her as the candidate ' natural beauty ' with the healthier body , good nutrition and responsible physical work .
meanwhile , the journalist guido hoyos , of cromos magazine considers that the error of the valley of cauca were the surgical interventions she suffered .
her body was never her strong advantage and here is where she was punished .
reality or not , the fact is that melina today begins a year of reign , not as sovereign , but as a princess , a position that gives her the opportunity to represent colombia in one of the international competitions designated by the national competition itself .
such was the work of the person who identified the body of alfonso cano
of the seven lophoscopists working in the branch of cti , this week it was the turn of " availability ' for eleazar gonzalez , a man of puerto tejada , who had spent 21 years working in the area of judicial investigation .
in 2000 he moved to the capital of the valley and , after making the corresponding courses , he specialized in lophoscopy , which is the study of skin friction , meaning the palms of the hands and feet .
he knew he had to identify two corpses and one was suspected to be of the man who led the world 's oldest guerrilla , so they asked him to take the ten print card of guillermo león sáenz ( his real name ) .
he was without beard , dressed as a farmer of the area , without glasses and much thinner .
accompanied by a galtonian magnifying glass , ink , a paddle and a flashlight , eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card .
that same night , the man from puerto tejada was asked to confirm the defense minister , juan carlos pinzón , that it was the top leader of the farc .
for a fingerprint specialist from sijin of cali the recognition made ​​by the president juan manuel santos to eleazar gonzalez in the press conference for the operation against " cano ' , is very significant .
the fingerprinting science is an exact science , without error , which can be key solution in solving crimes .
the researcher said that , in a case of theft , he had to remove a piece of the wall of a house because in that place the thief had supported his hand on to take a safe full of jewels and money .
the prints can also rule out or confirm suspects in murder cases .
through the investigation it was determined that a relative could be suspected of the crime and , indeed , a print on the bottle matched .
a fingerprint expert of cti explained that in objects " footprints are drawn with chemical or physical reagents . "
after that , the prints are sent to asif , which is the criminal database , or at the registry .
he clarified that not everything is as shown in csi television program .
the members of the movement occupy wall street challenged on tuesday the authorities of new york when trying to enter again , under the protection of a court order , in the manhattan square where they were evacuated at dawn when trying to occupy another park of the big apple .
" our idea is that if the court does not allow us to return to camp in the square , we will camp somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to zuccotti , and through peaceful sit - ins and demonstrations , " said one of the spokesmen of the movement " occupy wall street , " mark bray .
in addition , the " angry persons " proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of the downtown canal street and sixth avenue , near the entrance to the holland tunnel , which connects new york and new jersey , owned by the parish of trinity church .
the organization ensures that there are several hundred people camped at that point , where a delegation of religious leaders has already gone to show their support to the members of the movement trying to mediate with the police .
some of the protesters moved there were carrying and distributing at that time copies of that court order and even they gave these copies to officers guarding the place , which led to " some small confrontations , " said bray , who claimed that some officers beaten the demonstrators .
mayor bloomberg told reporters that , because of that court order , the city had suspended the reopening of the public space and protesters were informed , however , that local laws do not allow them to re - install with camping shops and sleeping bags .
bloomberg said he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming " a place where people did not come to protest , but to break the law and , in some cases , to do harm to others " as " some businesses had received threats ' and neighbors feared " for the quality of life . "
the responsible of " occupy wall street " also indicated that they intend to organize " great deeds " for thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions , in order to commemorate the last two months of protests , which began on september 17th .

the private television channel ctv announced today that anderson , along with the " crooner " ( ballad singer ) michael buble and other prominent canadians , will appear on the television program " it 's a russell peters christmas " on december 1st , interpreting a very different mary .

recently , buble called " bitch " the american kim kardashian during one of his concerts in new york .
gdp grows by 1.5 % due to domestic consumption and puts an end to the downward spiral that began in march
the first estimates of tokyo government regarding the material losses amounted to $ 300,000 million , a blow that , despite the difficult global context , seems to have dimmed .
the one recorded in the second quarter , for the japanese the fiscal year begins in march 2012 - represents also the fastest rhythm of growth from january to march 2010 .
in fact , companies increased their investment by 1.1 % versus 0.9 % decline in capital expenditures which was observed from january to march , the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases .
japan has awakened , especially thanks to the evolution of the household consumption , which now represents 60 % of the japanese gdp .
with a stronger currency , the products are more expensive abroad , a serious slap for a country whose economic line is determined by the health of large technological groups .
as markets continue their siege of the peripheral countries of the eu , the government of yoshihiko noda does not lower the guard .
the indicator that anticipates the turning points in the global economy showed that the major powers are slowing .
the euro zone even fell below the average , which is at the level of 100 , since it rushed eight tenths up to 99.13 points .
papademos said that adjustments will be approved , but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
the feeling that the " consent " of the new transitional government of hellene comes imposed more by the demands of brussels than by a genuine conviction of political forces began to be confirmed by facts .
" the main task of this government is implementing the decisions of the summit of october 26th , " papademos said yesterday when opening a parliamentary debate that it will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new executive .
however , the message of samaras does not clear the doubts about his position : " we are committed to helping the transitional government , but we are not committed to anything . "
but the european commission , still having a nappy rash by the impact caused by the all or nothing statement of the papandreou referendum , reiterated yesterday that its demand is clear : it will not unlock the help if the new government and the leaders of hellene major parties do not sign " a written commitment without ambiguity and this as soon as possible . "
the queen highlights the " dominant " place in spain in relation to this type of finance
queen sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become over the last two decades the second donor in relation to the instruments of cooperation ; whose " essence " she said lies in being an " instrument for social progress , justice and hope for a better future for all humanity , based on trust in human beings . "
spain is " still working " to expand the network of beneficiaries all over the world , and assumes the task with " responsibility " said mrs. sofia , who hoped that the efforts and contributions originated in the summit , which will be held until thursday , will " ensure the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest people , and especially for women , " the main beneficiaries of these loans .
the microcredit summit arises not only as a forum for debate , but also as a platform that promotes " two basic goals . "
the impulse for the creation of micro credits in spain and in the rest of the world " has followed the path started years ago " by muhammad yunus , highlighted mrs. sofia as an " act of justice and recognition . "
this experience was followed a year later by the first world summit in washington and other meetings such as those held in ivory coast in 1999 , canada 2006 , and " in all i have seen the continued evolution , " said his majesty , whose link with this project made her earn yesterday the title of the " head of the family " in valladolid from the " banker of the poor . "
in this regard , she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries in times of economic boom , as it is a " continuing obligation . "
for spain , microcredit is " one of the main lines of development cooperation . "
the future of europe was not initially planned to be on the programme , but imposed itself in the autumn , in particular to satisfy the militants who will be watching the government 's policy on greece today and perhaps that on italy tomorrow ....
out of 1001 delegates , only nine voted against and ten abstained from voting .
the main idea of the chancellor and of the motion , is embodied in the slogan " the right response to the crisis is not less europe , but more europe . "
this is , generally speaking , the case of one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the congress , whose inspiration clearly comes from wolfgang schäuble .
anxious to calm the climate in her party , the chancellor increased the number of her references to konrad adenauer and to helmut kohl , but she did not seek to influence the congress on the back of the " small " european countries , or of countries in difficulty , which are quick to criticise " arrogant " germany .
in fact , it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the napoleonic army .
after allowances , the ump and the government are launching an offensive against sick leave .
and to help this offensive stemming from a desire to make economies in the context of constraints , but which also forms part of the presidential re - election campaign , the majority want to concentrate on sick leave .
clearly , without the specific consent of the employer , an employee falling sick will lose four days ' pay equal to at least 15 % of his / her monthly income .
and which would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic effect , namely , the imposition on public employees of one day 's wait for benefit payment in the case of sick leave ( public employees have not hitherto had to wait for the payment of benefit , as against a three days ' wait by private employees ) .
" the controls will become more rigid and in addition , if you are caught , you will have to repay any non - legitimate benefit received , " warned xavier bertrand on rtl on sunday 13 november .
this has actually been monitored constantly since 2002 via political offensives , which have usually borne fruit .
according to l'institut de recherche et de documentation en economie de la santé , the daily compensation expenditure in 2008 at 11,3 thousand million euros , was 5 % of total health expenditure .
an average , which conceals certain divergences ; another inquiry published in 2007 by the monster.com career management site , showed that 75 % of the 40 000 french employees questioned said that they had not taken any days of sick leave .
comparing these figures with those of their european neighbours , french employees are no more inclined to take sick leave than those in any other country .
sickness certificate - related fraud is very low , compared with " black " labour .
the strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic controls of certificates valid for longer than 45 days .
in the case of systematically controlled certificates valid for more than 45 days , 11 % cases were found to be " inappropriate or unjustified " out of 1,2 million , equal to 132 000 .
a figure which represents very few cases , compared , for example , with the " black " labour figure .
papademos : greece must implement a new adjustment plan
this was declared on monday 14 november by the prime minister lucas papadémos in parliament , adding that the 100 days granted to his coalition government were not long enough for the accomplishment of this task .
the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the eurozone on 27 october shall be the " principal task " of the new government , because participation of the country in the eurozone " is at stake , " he added .
" we will not vote in favour of new measures , " he said at a meeting with the deputies of his new democracy party .
to olli rehn , the european commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs , who warned that the fmi and the eu would not unblock the loan of 8 thousand million euros required , without a written guarantee of all parties that they would support the planned measures , antonio samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under outside pressure .
canadians are living half dead , according to a report of the royal society of canada
this is one the conclusions of an imposing report by the royal society of canada , in which six experts in different fields took part , including ethics , the law and medicine .
at the outset , the experts cite a recent inquiry by the economist intelligence unit , which compared the quality of death in 40 countries worldwide .
medicalisation or not , 77 % of canadians do not have access to palliative care , report experts appointed by the royal society of canada .
countrywide , it is in quebec that the rate is highest , with 86 % of deaths taking place in hospital .
now , according to the experts who also reviewed the position of all countries where these actions have been legalised or decriminalised , there is no proof that the aid decriminalisation involves abuses of application , that is to say , the practice of euthanasia , or of assisted suicide on persons who are not competent , or not consenting .
and the legalisation of euthanasia would not result in sending a message that the life of aged or handicapped persons had less value .
regarding the continuation , or the withdrawal of nursing care of a patient , the situation is less clear , say the authors of the report .
the committee of experts also requests that health professionals should be trained in the duty to respect a withdrawal of nursing care at the end of life without having to fear criminal prosecution .
lastly , concerning palliative sedation already widely used in canadian health institutions , the committee asks that it should be considered where it only serves to reduce physical pain , as does euthanasia and that it should be subject to the same procedures .
certain experts in the field of the health - related legislation have already voiced reservations concerning the conclusions of the royal society of canada experts ' report .
" this opens the door on a situation where everyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old , could ask for help to commit suicide , says me deschamps , who yesterday consulted a summary of the report .
he says that " in society there are signposts and constraints .
margaret somerville , who is herself a member of the royal society of canada , contests , in particular , the data of the report concerning abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have been legalised as in the netherlands and in oregon .
the partisans of bachar al-assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the offices of the ministry of foreign affairs .
two days after the suspension of syria from membership of the arab league , the european union has reinforced its sanctions against damascus , whilst syria 's neighbours turkey and jordan , came out in favour of president assad 's departure .
" if bachar had the interest of his country at heart , he would have to resign , but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of the political life , said the king of jordan , a neighbouring country of syria , in a bbc interview .
" those in the middle east who are at peace with their people , but cannot satisfy their aspirations , will leave power , he said , alluding to syria , a neighbouring country , on which turkey is adopting an increasingly hard line .
" the international community , the united states , the european union , the arab legaue , and countries such as turkey , are adopting an increasingly harder line " in the face of the the repression in syria , observed mark toner , a spokesman of the state department .
two other civilians died during exchanges of fire and heavy rifles at jobar in the besieged town of homs , according tot his ong .
he moreover reacted strongly against the decision of the arab league to suspend damascus which according to him represents a " dangerous step . "
after its decision to suspend syria , the arab league is at present studying " a protection mechanism for civilians and wants the dispatch of 500 members of of arab rights of man organisations , of media and of military observers into the country .
a new extraordinary meeting of the league is planned for tomorrow to debate the implementation of escape from the crisis decided on 2 november and foreseeing in particular , the withdrawal of armed forces from the towns in dispute and the liberation of arrested demonstrators .
the future head of the italian government , mario monti , has asked the markets for a little time to form his team and to implement a programme , which will involve " sacrifices , " in order to recover credibility lost over the last few months of the berlusconi government .
he will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet composed of technocrats from outside parliament .
the president of the chamber or deputies , gianfranco fini , said that he would wait to learn if mario monti would ask parliament for a vote of confidence between now and friday , to ascertain whether the new government had enough support .
m. monti commented on the nervousness of the stockmarkets here , asking them for time .
his appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets , but disquiet re - emerged , in particular after an unexpected fall in industrial production in eurozone in september .
the new government would have to last until 2013 , the date of the next election , he said .
m. monti undertook that once in office he would work hard to ensure that italy would once again become a protagonist in europe .
the european union , being convinced that rome would not achieve its objective budget in 2013 despite the austerity plan adopted over recent months , has asked , in particular , for stringent new measures .
m. monti , known for his competence and for his independence when he was european commissioner ( 1994-2004 ) , represents a " change of epoch " for italy after 17 years of " berlusconism , " the " professor " symbolising " the challenge of seriousness " and " another italy , " according to the leaderwriters .
president napolitano would like to avoid an early election , because by april 2012 italy must place state debentures worth 200 thousand million euros .
a russian scientist , vycheslav danilenko , assisted iran to develop a detonator usable with a nuclear weapon , confirmed on monday an american agency specialising in the field of atomic hazard .
last week , aiea announced its serious disquiet concerning a " possible military dimension " of the iranian nuclear programme .
in 1989 or 1991 he left the centre to establish a company producing " nano - diamants " in kiev .
he then cooperated on an iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 , before returning to russia .
according to these figures , the total number of cases of violence against moslems moved from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010 , equal to an increase of 49 % , as against an increase of 13 % of cases of violence against catholics , a fall of 4 % of attacks on jews and a global increase of 14 % in anti - religious crimes .
" after a decrease in 2009 , it is disturbing to see these crimes increasing again , stressed the rights of man organisation , human rights first , " the increase of cases of anti - moslem violence is particularly significant , " added the organisation in a communiqué .
" the american government can and must do more to deal with his abuse , he adds , judging that this could be due to the editing of police reports on hate crimes . "
this legislation was passed after the death of martin luther king to punish acts of violence linked to race , colour of skin , religion , origin and now sexual orientation .
on monday , the microblog site twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform , to allow its users , in particular , to observe the activity of those whom they are monitoring , which makes its service resemble that of facebook .
this enables one to know if they cause messages to be monitored , if they subscribe new accounts , if they have favourite messages , etc.
twitter , which has been known so far for being rather unintuitive , and for its use of somewhat esoteric terms ( rt for re - posting someone else 's message , #followfriday for recommending following other users ) , much to the delight of experienced users , is thus opening itself to a wider audience by offering a user experience closer to those of popular social networks facebook and google + .
" it is useless , invasive and resembles facebook excessively "
the government of the great social democratic / christian democratic coalition in power in austria decided on tuesday to write a budgetary " golden rule " into the constitution , in order to reduce public deficits and so avoid a possible downgrading by rating agencies of austria 's sovereign credit rsting ( triple a ) .
" if the solvency of austria had not fallen by a single notch , from aaa to aa + , we would have to pay three thousand million euros of interest more every year , " argued the vice - chancellor and christian democratic foreign minister , michael spindelegger .
the dispositions adopted by the austrian government approach the " german model , " being the first european country to adopt this " rule . "
the objective is that of making public debt fall below the 60 % criterion fixed by the treaty of maastricht by 2020/2021 .
" we would intervene as we did the last time , if we found excessive volatility in the rate of exchange of the yen , explained m. noda to the senate .
on that date , tokyo sold the yen against the dollar on a massive scale in order to cut the value of the japanese currency , which was setting a new record of strength since 1945 .
on tuesday , the dollar fell below 77 yen and the euro fell under the symbolic bar of 105 yen , close to levels which triggered the last intervention .
this rise of the japanese currency damages japanese exports , because it makes japanese products more expensive and reduces the value of income of japanese firms from abroad , when converted into the national currency .
the world 's third biggest economic power has resumed growth in the third quarter -1 , 5 % compared with the previous quarter - for the first time for a year , thanks to a rise in exports and consumption of households affected by the catastrophe .
the minister of finance , jun azumi , called on the bank of japan ( boj ) , which on tuesday opened a two - day meeting of its monetary policy council , to take every necessary step to weaken the yen .
since its last meeting at the end of october , the issuing institution increased by 5.000 million yen ( 47 thousand million euro 's ) worth of treasury bond purchases , raising the ceiling to 55.000 thousand million yen ( 519 thousand million euros ) , which it is devoting to the purchase of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market .
despite the appointment of new heads of government in greece and in italy and better growth figures in france and in germany , the rates in fragile countries continue to rise .
in paris , at 10 a.m. , the cac 40 lost 1,4 % to end at 3.064 points .
" with the new tensions about the yield of loans of eurozone states in difficulties , the share markets worldwide contimue to lose a part of their recent gains . "
the tokyo exchange closed with a fall of 0,7 % , suffering fresh doubts of market participants on the subject of the capacity of europe to contain the debt crisis .
this re - emergence of disquiet about the future of eurozone penalises the single currency , which has continued to fall on tuesday .
towards 10 a.m. the european currency is worth 1,3570 dollars , having fallen by 0,4 % .
this tuesday morning the yield of italian 10 - year debentures attained 6,85 % , that of spanish ones of the same maturity date , 6,2 % .
the head of the future italian government , mario monti asked the markets for time to restore the situation in an italy threatened by asphyxia by the weight of its debt .
spain finds itself in the line of fire by the markets ahead of the parliamentary elections on sunday .
the inseen nevertheless revised downwards the figure for the second quarter , with a fall of 0,1 % of the gross internal product ( pib ) instead of stagnation .
germany for its part , ha recorded a growth of 0,5 % for the same period .
if there is a topic which cannot be dealt with via short - term considerations , or under the stress of emotion , it is energy policy .
it is healthy that an electoral rendezvous should be an occasion for reflecting on such stakes and the place occupied by nuclear power .
the french must base their opinion on the objective facts of rational data .
during the same period , it will become necessary to palliate the increasing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity permanently without forgetting the overriding need to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases to fight climatic imbalance , a subject which has vanished from the ecological debate .
this is why germany is isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear energy .
on the other hand , great britain , finland , poland , the czech republic , the netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil to quote only a few , pursue their projects with determination .
although the german model based on renewable energies is sometimes quoted as an example , the reality contradicts that argument .
champion of europe in the construction of turbines , from which it draws 30 % of its electricity , it is also one of the largest users of coal and of gas due to intermittent wind ; due to which its carbon dioxide emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65 % and 50 % higher than the european average .
since in the worldwide economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a stake in the maintenance of the industrial tool in the national territory , french companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in europe .
a price , which a large majority of the french refuse to pay , all the more so , since they do not object to this form of energy in principle .
strongly export - oriented , it attracts a galaxy of specialised rme 's in international markets and creates many jobs , which cannot be moved elsewhere .
what electrician would recommend a epr designed to function for sixty years , if the decline of its manufacture was programmed ?
the development by areva of low carbon dioxide emission solutions , nuclear and renewable , bears witness to the complementary nature sources of energy .
in france , we have a safety authority , which exercises an intransigent and transparent control of existing generation centres such as flamanville .
in a space of 50 years , the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents .
at tchernobyl , the design of the reactor and unforgivable human error brought about the drama .
the nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident , as it has from its two predecessors .
since it is being considered by all electricians wishing to construct a generation centre , a decision to construct it at flamanville would be a magnificent gift to the competitors of areva and edf by clearing their way to seizing the leadership of the unavoidable development of nuclear energy .
more recently , it is administrative harassment of foreign students , which is topical , with the minister of the interior ( " libération " on 23 may ) declaring that france " does not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see immigrants as a burden on the french economy and on french society .
in his programme , françois hollande confines himself to banalities , saying that co - development would allow our immigration problem to be solved . "
as the economists ian goldin and geoffrey cameron , remind us in a recent book summarising the most recent knowledge of immigration ( exceptional people : how migration shaped our world and will define our future , mai 2011 , princeton university press , 352 pp . ) , there is wide consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , wages and employment in countries , which admit immigrants .
fears about the impact of immigrants are based on the notion that they are liable to replace native workers , in particular unskilled ones , exerting downward pressure on wages .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors , which do not attract local labour and the most highly skilled ones in dynamic sectors where training does is not linked to offers of employment .
in the same way as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists , the complementarities existing between locals and immigrants bring it about that the arrival of immigrants has a positive effect on the pay of locals .
and does so without taking into account the fact that the diversity contributed by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to economic growth ( a large proportion of naturalised immigrants are among american nobel prizewinners , whilst google , intel , paypal , ebay and yahoo were all founded by immigrants ) .
th world labour organisation estimates that for example in germany , an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 , will make a net contribution ( receipts less expenditure ) of an average of 150,000 euros to public budgets during his lifetime .
the teeth in question , intended to serve to dissuade immigrants , had precisely the opposite effect .
democracy is a precious possession ; it is also a fragile one .
some believed that it was enough for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies , to exercise the vote , and to do so as directly as possible .
universal suffrage , in order to be the sine qua non of democracy , is not enough and can actually become a " tool of oppression " as once said the republican philosopher etienne vacherot .
the european crisis , which we are passing through , is an economic crisis , but it is primarily a political crisis and a crisis of democracy .
we have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums organised as required and in a confused sequence .
no , we do not want the blades of a guillotine , but an exercise , joint , serene and ongoing , of choice and of democracy , this time on european level .
it is the whole of europe , which defers to the dictates of the markets and of rating agencies , who suffer from their incapacity and a lack of solidarity .
there is disquiet about the transfer of sovereignty to europe , but it is the entire europe , which is gradually losing its sovereignty , and with its each of its nations .
because it is by all working together , that europeans will be able reduce the weight of their individual debts , to free themselves from the markets and to prepare for the future by investing in it .
after having long fought this proposal by specialists and of jacques delors , the whole world now calls for a european economic government .
but the idea without stronger economic , political and democratic integration and lived in such by citizens , would be a fresh folly and a new impasse .
to establish the republic in france , it was necessary to " make " republicans .
this can only be done by constructing a more democratic europe on political level , a real popular european sovereignty .
the year 2011 should actually end on an 11 % rise of worldwide sales of microprocessors ( bank cards , telephones with a sim card . . . ) , with over 6 thousand million units , according to eurosmart .
this year , 460 million of contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide , as against 320 millions a year earlier !
for a long time , lagging behind the asia - pacific region , europe is now gaining ground in contactless payment .
in france , the start is more modest ; 400.000 contactless visa card are in use .
this year , carrefour issued 2,5 million contactless mastercards .
" two large french establishments have undertaken to distribute systematically in future to their clients , bank cards equipped for contactless use , announces gérard nébouy , director - general of visa europe france .
but this is only a first stage of the future mode of payment , namely , the mobile telephone .
" we are counting on a worldwide sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 , explains marc bertin , president of eurosmart .
yesterday , crédit agricole announced a test to run from next december to june in caen .
suspected for a long time , the links between the terrorist group al-qaida in the islamic maghreb ( aqmi ) and the nigerian boko haram sect have been confirmed .
" the manner in which the two organisations operate and the reports of secret services show that there is a lot of cooperation , he explained without elaborating .
among the rubble left behind by the action , french and nigerian investigators found several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists .
the analysis of calls exchanged indicates several interlocutors based in mali , in niger and in nigeria .
" this is an advance , but it is undoubtedly necessary to await more exact proofs before talking about operational cooperation between aqmi and boko haram . "
" it has been known for years that the sect benefits from outside financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active , says kunle amuwo , a nigerian researcher .
the international community , starting with washington , is now exerting pressure on abuja to take into account the problems caused by boko haram .
the latter target primarily churches , bars and administrations .
last christmas it claimed an attack , which left 80 dead at jos and then more at abuja .
in august , the local united nations headquarters will be its first international target .
now that aqmi has invested mali and niger and the somalis of al-chebab operate in kenya , boko haram appears to be a new menace in the continent .
can an america weakened by crisis , lead a complex world by simple and indeed , simplistic , ideas ?
for some days , mitt romney , herman cain , rick perry and the others multiply resounding and abbreviated foreign policy declarations , which are traditionally a republican strong suit .
mitt romney , the best placed for nomination of the " grand old party , " threatened to drag the chinese before the omc and to accuse them of " manipulation of their currency , a sensitive subject in an america exasperated by the migration of whole sections of its industry to asia .
jon huntsman , obama 's former ambassador to china and the only candidate with a vision of a sophisticated foreign policy , has failed to suppress an attitude which flatters the emotions .
but huntsman , who is stagnating at the bottom of the polls , remains inaudible .
romney also promised military strikes on iran , if sanctions failed to stop its nuclear programme .
" if obama is re - elected , they will have the bomb . "
the entrepreneur herman cain , the second best - placed candidate , declares an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files .
the texas governor rick perry , who supports israel and wants military strikes against iran , says that he is ready to involve the usa army in mexico against the drug cartels .
one is far away from the 2008 republican candidate john mccain , a foreign policy heavyweight .
they recall that obama himself was an amateur and that he had to water down his wine concerning anti - terrorism .
since iraq , it distrusts military interventions , which run into quicksands .
the north stream , a new portal for the entry of russian gas into europe
it is scheduled to supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes .
over 500 guests including four heads of state and of government took part last tuesday on the shores of the baltic , between an orchestral performance and a fine buffet , in the inauguration of north stream , the new gasduct , which directly links russia and germany under the sea .
with this new gasduct , 27,5 thousand million additional cubic metres of russian gas will arrive every year in western europe via a first pipeline of 1 224 km linking the region of saint petersburg to the land of mecklemburg - pomerania .
and the possibility of constructing a third pipeline of the same course is already under discussion .
these two countries will lose some of their power : it will become more difficult for them to influence russia by threatening to close access to west european markets .
but at the price of depriving europe of energy , since the project has created a breach between eastern and western europe .
" this gasduct is a component of partnership with russia , it is a new artery which links us organically , " confirmed françois fillon inaugurating the gasduct , demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are both politically and economically important .
" a hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution , " says jens müller , spokesman of north stream company .
the pipeline is a long metal serpent , of weight equivalent to that of 242 eiffel towers , with no breaks throughout its length , no valves and no maintenance stations .
" in case of accident we stop the passage of gas for at least one minute , " states jens müller .
but this is thought to be unlikely by the constructors who provided welds to leak only every 100 000 years .
being cigar - shaped , it is introduced inside the 1 - metre wide pipeline , and it is pushed along by the gas .
the gasduct was designed to work for 50 years without any need for even the smallest repair .
these five companies have created a joint enterprise called north stream , delegated to construct and to operate the gasduct .
gazprom next leased to this company for twenty renewable years , the entire capacity of gas transport .
the financing of the construction of the gasduct was provided to the extent of 30 % by the shareholders and of 70 % by bank loans .
the gasduct emerges from the baltic sea at lubmin on a sandy littoral planted with conifers .
sensors measure pressure , temperature and the specific gravities of arriving gas before being transferred into german gasducts .
at full capacity , this will be 3 million an hour and in 2012 , 6 million .
created fifteen years ago by an italian company , moleskine will restore the taste of writing .
the moleskine notebook is easily recognised , by its black rectangular cover , its elastic , its broken white pages , as if aged over time .
the italian company modo modo , based in milan , decided to launch a designer notebook .
the notebook draws its inspiration from an old production technique , the mole skin which means varnished cotton used for covering benches , for example .
" moleskine has been updated to meet current taste for an old and forgotten object , which was an avantgarde artists ' icon up to the xxth century , " related maria sebregondi , who has since become the manager of the brand name at modo modo .
between 2006 and 2010 , sales rose by 25 % to reach 12.7 million units .
moleskine is crossing the italian frontiers and is exporting to 70 countries , from france to the usa .
its distributes its notebooks to fnac libraries , small shops in town centres and has succeeded in becoming well known .
this cultural signature accompanies the development of moleskine ; recently , the brand launched an exhibition " detour " where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook .
exploiting its success and the cultural aura , moleskine diversified its products to include handbags , pens , computer bags . the brand includes every kind of support .
they are rather old : 37 % are over 50 ( 17 % on average ) .
lastly , long - term unemployment is very widespread , being 85 % for the handicapped versus 38 % on an average .
a study carried out in april by the association ims - entreprendre pour la cité showed that the managers questioned had a low level of knowledge of handicap , " with an " over - representation of persons in wheelchairs , psychically or intellectually deficient persons . "
the latter known figures dating to 2008 have a ratio of 2.6 % .
proof : the number of " taxed " establishments , like the sums paid , have fallen between 2007 and 2011 , from 59 000 to 46 000 structures ( and from 606 to 480 million euros ) .
" but this improvement also reflects a rise of consciousness , in particular within large groups . "
we do not go so far as to say that there was connivance between them , but the image is symbolic .
five months following the gesture of humour of his attacker against turkey , the belgian selector can only be praised .
" i want to go forward , assures the lillois .
" at lille , i am there all the year round , which is not the case of belgium . "
selected to play against romania on friday evening in its match against france , hazard went to saint - denis in order at last to " shine . "
he encouraged the blues from the age of 7 years and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000 .
" pride " also in inding ass " neighbour " that france has " become again a very high level team " only a little more than one year after the trauma of knysna .
" one is building something , the players are ambitious , they are hungry . "
