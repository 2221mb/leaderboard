Here are the steps that need to be done.

1. Download all assignment files from all users.  

Don't overwrite the old files.  If they've changed, we re-run the
analysis, but we save the old version and the new one.  New files
should be put in a directory where they can be scored and then
archived.

2. Score any files that have changed.

Take new files waiting to be scored and score them.  Write the scores
to a file. 

Store the results in a Google spreadsheet?  Is there any reason to add
that complexity?  I think no.

4. Update the web page

This should be a simple script that produces a table where the rows
can easily be reranked.
